      <link>http://www.knowthemeta.com/Blog/history-of-anarch-part-1</link>
      <content:encoded>These days the runner meta is saturated with Anarchs. I wanted to make an article about how we got here and why. I looked at the data I have, crunched the numbers, dug up some decks and tried to piece together the big picture. Here is the first part of the story.</content:encoded>

      <title>Thoughts on the "NAPD Most Wanted List"</title>
      <link>http://www.knowthemeta.com/Blog/NAPD-most-wanted</link>
      <content:encoded>Wow. The meta will be shaken. FFG announced some heavy stuff in their new Tournament Rules. A couple of cards will be nerfed, they reduce the Identity's influence count by 1 per each copy. This means the end of the currently popular archetypes. Influence has never been so tight. TL;DR version</content:encoded>
